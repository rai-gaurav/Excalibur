# Excalibur

Excalibur is inspired from [Doorman](https://github.com/mwielgoszewski/doorman) which is an osquery fleet manager that allows administrators to remotely manage the osquery configurations retrieved by nodes.

The aim is simple for now.
Harness the power of [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) and perform Malware analysis using third party API (Virus Total etc.)
